# Frontend Skeleton

This folder is reserved for the Angular 20 frontend.

During the lab you will run:

```powershell
cd frontend
ng new task-manager-frontend --routing=true --style=css --standalone
cd task-manager-frontend
```

Then generate components/services/guards/interceptor as guided in the incremental lab.
